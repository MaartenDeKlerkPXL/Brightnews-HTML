    "title": "Jacob Elordi: The Star Who Rejects Social Media",
    "summary": "Jacob Elordi, the 28-year-old Australian actor, is everywhere right now—except on social media. With his notable roles in series like 'Euphoria' and films such as 'Saltburn' and 'Priscilla', Elordi has established himself as one of Hollywood's most in-demand young actors. Yet, he chooses to keep his private life out of the reach of social media, a choice that is increasingly being made by more young actors and Generation Z individuals. In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Elordi stated, 'I have no relationship with social media.' This statement comes not only from an actor who values his privacy but also from someone who consciously chooses a life outside the spotlight of the digital world. Elordi's refusal to lose his life to the industry of social media is a testament to his dedication to his craft and his desire to lead an authentic life. 'My dream was to be an actor. My dream was to play in movies, and I'm too nervous to ask for more than that. I've been given exactly what I wanted, and I see it exactly how I dreamed it, and I live it how I dreamed it. For me, that's about all I can handle.' These words provide a deep insight into Elordi's philosophy on life and career. He has had an Instagram account in the past but often deactivates it. His account has been deactivated since late 2024. For Elordi, staying offline is a way to prevent Hollywood from taking over his entire identity. Despite his growing fame, he says that this boundary allows him to move through his private life mostly undisturbed. 'I have a pretty strong refusal to lose my life to an industry, you know. I consider myself an actor and nothing more. And so for me, life kind of goes on outside the set, outside these lights and cameras and things. I don't have too much trouble in the world.' Elordi's approach to his career and private life is a breath of fresh air in an industry often driven by social media and public attention. He emphasizes that he does not see himself as a Hollywood star but as an actor living his passion. 'It doesn't really factor into my reality, you know. I have so much love in my life, and the relationships I have in my life are so present and real. I was raised in such an authentic and true way. I feel so deeply here that, I don't know, the idea of this industry and stuff—it doesn't really factor into my day-to-day.' Elordi's stance is not unique. More and more Generation Z individuals, both within and outside of Hollywood, are choosing to live a life less dependent on social media. Mia Threapleton, the daughter of Kate Winslet, revealed in 2025 that her mother encouraged her to make a list of pros and cons for creating an Instagram account when she was 14. 'The cons completely outweighed the pros for me. That was quite a clarifying moment. Since then, I'm really happy that I don't have it.' This trend is not limited to Hollywood. Many Generation Z individuals are trading smartphones for 'dumb phones', using their mobile phones as landlines, and organizing 'anti-social media' parties where no one is allowed to scroll. This movement reflects a growing recognition of the negative effects of social media on mental health and well-being. Jacob Elordi's choice to stay offline is not only a personal statement but also a symptom of a broader cultural shift. It is a declaration of independence and a refusal to be defined by the digital world. In a time when social media has become an integral part of the lives of many, Elordi's approach is a reminder of the value of privacy and authenticity. His success in Hollywood, despite his absence on social media, is proof that it is possible to have a significant career without succumbing to the pressure of digital presence. Elordi's story is an inspiration to young actors and Generation Z individuals seeking a balance between career and private life. It underscores the importance of maintaining a healthy relationship with technology and prioritizing authentic human connections over virtual validation. In a world increasingly dominated by screens and likes, Jacob Elordi's choice to stay offline is a breath of fresh air and a reminder of the value of a life outside the digital bubbles.",

    "title": "Gong Cha's Battle: How a Bubble Tea Chain Leveraged Starbucks' Success",
    "summary": "In the world of entrepreneurship, it's not uncommon to learn from the successful strategies of others. Martin Berry, the founder and chairman of Gong Cha, has embraced this principle and turned it into a global bubble tea empire. His story is an inspiring example of how strategic location choice and a unique offering can lead to spectacular growth. Gong Cha, a brand known for its fragrant, fruity teas and its milk foam topping, now has nearly 2,200 stores in 33 countries. But how did it all begin?\n\nBerry's journey started in 2011 when he and his wife invested $2.5 million of their savings to open the first five Gong Cha franchise stores in South Korea. It was a risky move, as Berry quit his banking job to go all in on bubble tea. But his strategy was brilliant. He decided to open the first five Gong Cha stores right next to Starbucks outlets. His reasoning was simple but effective: if he could convince just one in a hundred customers who visited Starbucks to try Gong Cha, he would have a successful business.\n\nThis strategy was not only a clever marketing move but also a testament to Berry's belief in the product. He knew that once customers had tasted the unique flavor of Gong Cha's bubble tea, they would return. And so it happened. The first five stores were a huge success, and Gong Cha began to expand rapidly. Today, it is a global chain with a strong presence in various countries, including the United States and Canada.\n\nGong Cha's success is not unique in the world of bubble tea. Other brands, such as Mixue and Luckin Coffee, have also achieved great success. Mixue, the global fast-food chain that sells cheap bubble tea and ice cream, has more than 45,000 stores worldwide and opened its first outlet in New York at the beginning of the year. Luckin Coffee, another Asian beverage brand, has positioned itself as a competitor to Starbucks, offering similar drinks at lower prices. Luckin Coffee expanded to the United States last year, with several outlets in New York.\n\nThe growth of bubble tea brands is a testament to the global popularity of this drink. It is not just a trend but a phenomenon that continues to grow. And Gong Cha, with its strategic location choices and unique products, is one of the key players in this market. Berry's story is an inspiring example of how a smart strategy and belief in the product can lead to spectacular growth and success.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Berry spoke about his journey and how he expanded Gong Cha from a small brand in Taiwan to a global chain. He talked about the challenges and the triumphs, and how he learned from the successful strategies of others. His story is an inspiring example of how an entrepreneur can grow and adapt to the changing market.\n\nGong Cha's success is not only a testament to Berry's vision and strategy but also to the power of franchising. By using franchising, Gong Cha was able to expand rapidly and build a strong presence in various countries. This has not only promoted the growth of the brand but has also given local entrepreneurs the opportunity to participate in Gong Cha's success.\n\nThe future of Gong Cha looks bright. With its strong presence in various countries and the growing popularity of bubble tea, the brand is well-positioned to continue growing. And with Berry at the helm, it is clear that Gong Cha will continue to innovate and adapt to the changing market. His story is an inspiring example of how an entrepreneur can grow and adapt to the changing market, and how a smart strategy and belief in the product can lead to spectacular growth and success.",

    "title": "Snowflake's CEO warns: software giants risk becoming a 'dumb data pipe' to AI models",
    "summary": "In a recent interview, the CEO of Snowflake, Sridhar Ramaswamy, issued a warning that calls into question the future of software companies in the shadow of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Ramaswamy, who took the helm of Snowflake in 2024 after his time as a partner at Greylock Ventures and as co-founder of the AI search engine Neeva, shares his insights on the Big Technology Podcast by Alex Kantrowitz. His warning is clear: the largest software companies risk becoming mere data sources for AI labs, while they themselves are reduced to 'dumb data pipes' that feed data into the 'big brains' of AI models. This is a scenario that not only threatens the future of software companies but also the way businesses manage and use their data. Ramaswamy emphasizes that AI companies like OpenAI are striving to consolidate enterprise data in one place, shifting control and access to data from the companies themselves to the AI labs. This consolidation could lead to a situation where software companies lose their value if they only function as data suppliers. To prevent this, Ramaswamy advocates for a solution where customers retain control over their data and decide for themselves how they want to access their information. This would mean that companies can choose direct access via their own agents or through products like ChatGPT. The rise of AI labs as software providers is a recent development that threatens traditional software companies. OpenAI, for example, has recently entered the sales, support, and document analysis market, putting pressure on companies like Salesforce and Oracle. Despite these developments, Anish Acharya, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, warns that software companies are being unfairly punished by Wall Street out of fear that AI will take over their industry. Acharya emphasizes that legacy software cannot be easily replaced because it is not profitable to use AI for every business function. He points out that software accounts for only 8% to 12% of business costs, making the savings from using AI limited. Instead, companies should focus on developing their core businesses and optimizing other costs. The warnings from Ramaswamy and Acharya come at a time when software stocks have had a brutal start to the month, dragging down tech and broader markets. The sell-off began when already-wary investors panicked over Anthropic's new AI tool, which can perform a range of clerical tasks for people working in the legal industry. The impact of these developments on the software industry is significant. If software companies lose their value and are reduced to data suppliers, this would not only affect their profit margins but also their innovation potential. This could lead to a situation where control and access to data are entirely in the hands of AI labs, limiting competition and choice for businesses. To prevent this, it is essential that software companies maintain their value by investing in innovation and providing customers with the means to manage and use their data in a way that best suits their needs. This could mean that software companies develop new products and services that help customers use their data effectively, such as advanced analytical tools or integrations with AI models. It is also important that software companies collaborate with AI labs to ensure that their products and services are compatible with the latest AI technologies. Through this collaboration, software companies can maintain their value and provide customers with the means they need to succeed in a world where AI plays an increasingly important role. The warnings from Ramaswamy and Acharya are a wake-up call for the software industry. It is essential that software companies maintain their value and provide customers with the means to manage and use their data in a way that best suits their needs. By investing in innovation and collaborating with AI labs, software companies can strengthen their market position and provide customers with the means they need to succeed in a world where AI plays an increasingly important role.",

    "title": "Trump's trade advisor demands Big Tech to bear the cost of AI data centers",
    "summary": "In a recent interview on Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures', Peter Navarro, trade advisor to President Donald Trump, stated that big technology companies must bear the full cost of their AI infrastructure. Navarro emphasized that data center builders must 'internalize the costs' their AI infrastructure creates, such as electricity, water, and grid strain. According to him, companies 'need to pay for all of the costs', and taxpayers should not bear the impact of AI growth. The White House must ensure that the American people are not disadvantaged, Navarro said. These comments come as the AI data center boom faces increasing scrutiny over rising utility bills. Tech giants are pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure to power artificial intelligence. In November, Meta pledged $600 billion to expand AI technology, infrastructure, and its workforce. Apple said in August it would boost its US infrastructure plans by adding another $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion. Meanwhile, energy costs are rising. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate hikes from regulators last year, more than twice the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many power providers have cited surging electricity demand from large-scale data centers as a key reason for seeking higher rates. President Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that households should absorb those increases. 'I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,' the president wrote last month in a post on Truth Social. The 'big technology companies who build them,' the president said, 'must pay their own way.' Navarro also said on Fox News that the US must keep expanding its data center capacity if it wants to remain 'No.1 on the global stage in terms of AI.' 'We have to lead China and others on this,' Navarro said. 'At the same time, we have to be mindful of the impacts across this nation.' The US must stay ahead 'not just for economic reasons but for national security reasons,' because AI 'will be one of the most dangerous weapons of war,' he added. Some AI companies have moved to reassure policymakers that households won't bear the cost of the industry's rapid expansion. Anthropic said on Thursday that it will cover 100% of the grid upgrade costs associated with its AI data centers. 'The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,' Anthropic said. 'But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.' The pledge follows the company's November announcement that it plans to invest $50 billion in AI infrastructure, starting with facilities in Texas and New York. Microsoft has taken a similar approach. Last month, the company said it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the electricity costs tied to its data centers and minimize the burden of data center expansion on surrounding communities.",

    "title": "A Gen Zer drained her savings building a startup. A 6-figure job at Meta helped her start over — then she quit.",
    "summary": "When Alyson Isaacs joined Meta in 2022, she had about $200 in her savings account after exhausting her funds on a startup. A six-figure salary offered a chance to rebuild her finances, but her ultimate goal lay outside Big Tech. After college, Isaacs 'completely drained' her savings on a startup she'd co-founded, and found herself grappling with her next career move. After weighing her options, she decided to follow the advice of a mentor: go to 'startup rehab' — in other words, take a full-time job. 'You can always get a job at a Big Tech company,' said Isaacs, who's 28 and lives in San Francisco. About four months later, she landed a product manager role at Meta in the company's Quest for Business virtual reality division. But her entrepreneurial itch never left, and she eventually began mapping out the best path back into the startup world. 'There are ways you can be entrepreneurial,' she said of working at Big Tech, 'but it's very much not the same.' Over the past year, I've interviewed more than a dozen workers who, like Isaacs, chose to quit their jobs at major employers — in some cases without another role lined up. While some eventually landed at another large company, others stepped away from the corporate world entirely — joining a smaller business, launching their own venture, pursuing a career pivot, or focusing on personal priorities like parenting. They've become outliers in an economy where workers are quitting at one of the lowest rates in the past decade — a trend driven by a hiring slowdown that's left some clinging to their jobs with few appealing alternatives. Those who have called it quits told me they did so for a mix of reasons: concerns about job security, shifts in workplace culture, entrepreneurial ambitions, or a desire for more meaningful work. In short, they wanted greater long-term agency over their careers. Isaacs shared how she decided to take the leap back into entrepreneurship — and offered advice for others facing a similar career crossroads. Business Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. After leaving her post-college startup, Isaacs took a month to reset. She then spent two months interviewing at smaller companies to fine-tune her résumé and sharpen her interview skills. Eventually, she applied for a role at Meta and landed the job. She moved from the Berkeley area to San Francisco and started in May 2022 — about a year after graduation. While Isaacs didn't have firm plans to return to entrepreneurship, she knew that if she ever went down that path again, she'd need to be financially prepared for life without a steady paycheck. So she started living well below her means, including living in a less expensive area, going to a basic gym, cooking at home, and avoiding shopping sprees. 'I saved so hard because I knew that this wasn't going to be the end game for me, and I wanted to start my own thing again eventually,' she said. Isaacs also prepared for a potential return to entrepreneurship by spending about five hours a week angel investing, which involved scouting and backing startups. After about a year of saving, she began making a few investments, each under $10,000. She said the experience helped her build a network in San Francisco's startup scene and spot gaps other entrepreneurs could exploit — insights that helped shape her own business ideas. The final phase of Isaacs' preparation was soaking up everything she could from her time at Meta, including transitioning to a product manager position at Instagram — one of Meta's subsidiaries — in 2024. She said the roles gave her knowledge and experience that entrepreneurship alone couldn't provide. 'Traditional entrepreneurship was just flying by the edge of my seat and seeing what worked,' she said. 'But I needed that level of expertise to go farther in my career.' The question was when to make the leap and leave Meta. Isaacs said the death of her father in 2024 weighed heavily on her thought process. 'That really triggered this thought in my brain of, 'Is being a product manager at a Big Tech company what I want to do for the rest of my life?'' she said. 'And the answer was resoundingly no — I wanted to do something on my own and prove myself.' By mid-2025, Isaacs found herself thinking more and more about a startup idea in the consumer AI space — and struggling to focus on her job at Meta. On July 1, she resigned; the next day, she began working full-time on her startup, which she described as an 'agentic AI solution for personal wellness.' The company is currently in stealth, meaning the team isn't publicly sharing full details while the product is still in development. She said she and her two co-founders are testing the product with users and plan to open a pre-seed funding round in the spring. Isaacs said she knows many people might hesitate to give up a Big Tech job. But she believes some underestimate their chances of finding a new role or building something themselves — and end up stuck in jobs they don't enjoy. 'It's kind of like dating,' she said, adding that if you anticipate a bad dating pool, 'you're going to stay with your bad ex.' Isaacs said she wasn't worried about resigning from Meta, in part because she's a 'super optimist' about her career. If her startup doesn't work out, she's confident in her backup plan — the same one she relied on after her post-college startup opportunity fell through. 'Leaving Meta wasn't scary for me because I was like, 'I can always get another job in Big Tech,' she said. Isaacs has a few pieces of advice for other aspiring entrepreneurs. She recommends connecting with as many people as possible who are relevant to the venture you want to pursue — and looking for ways to help them, whether through angel investing, advising, or offering support. 'You kind of create this flywheel of people helping you if you help other people first,' she said. Additionally, even if your end goal is to build a business, Isaacs said having experience at a big-name company can give you valuable credibility as an entrepreneur. 'I needed to be undeniable as a founder, and having a big-box name brand on your résumé gives you that undeniability,' she said.",

    "title": "Electronic coach revolutionizes ski jumping: Technology as the key to Olympic gold",
    "summary": "In the world of ski jumping, where every fraction of a second can be decisive, revolutionary technology brings a new dimension of precision and feedback. An electronic coach, designed to help ski jumpers optimize their performance, is poised to transform the sport. This article explores how this technology works, what it means for the future of ski jumping, and whether it can ever replace the traditional coach.\n\nThe decisive moment during ski jumping, the takeoff, lasts only fractions of a second. In that short time, a ski jumper must do everything perfectly: the right posture, the perfect timing, and the maximum power. Errors in these fractions of a second can make the difference between a medal and a disappointing performance. The new technology, developed by a team of engineers and sports scientists, makes this crucial moment measurable and provides immediate feedback. This enables ski jumpers to refine their technique and improve their performance.\n\nThe electronic coach works using advanced sensors and cameras that track every movement of the ski jumper. This data is processed and analyzed in real-time, providing the ski jumper with immediate feedback on their performance. The technology can, for example, detect if the ski jumper takes off too early or too late, or if their posture during the flight is not optimal. This feedback allows ski jumpers to quickly improve their technique and optimize their performance.\n\nOne of the main advantages of this technology is that it enables ski jumpers to analyze and improve their performance even when their coach is not present. This is particularly useful for ski jumpers who train in remote areas or who do not have the means to afford a full-time coach. The electronic coach can also be used to track the progress of a ski jumper over time, giving coaches and athletes a better insight into the effectiveness of their training.\n\nBut can this technology ever replace the traditional coach? While the electronic coach is a powerful tool, it cannot fully replace the human touch and experience of a seasoned coach. A coach can not only provide feedback on technique but also motivate, develop strategies, and mentally prepare a ski jumper for competitions. Moreover, a coach can better understand and adapt to the unique needs and strengths of a ski jumper.\n\nNevertheless, the electronic coach offers a valuable addition to traditional coaching. It enables ski jumpers to optimize their performance and refine their technique even when their coach is not present. It can also be used to track the progress of a ski jumper over time, giving coaches and athletes a better insight into the effectiveness of their training.\n\nThe future of ski jumping may lie in a combination of traditional coaching and advanced technology. The electronic coach can be a powerful tool to help ski jumpers optimize their performance and refine their technique. But it is the human touch and experience of a seasoned coach that can ultimately make the difference between a good and an outstanding performance. In the years to come, we will likely see that the electronic coach becomes an integral part of the training of ski jumpers, alongside traditional coaching. This will not only improve the performance of ski jumpers but also transform the sport as a whole.",

    "summary": "Hollywood, the global leader in entertainment, is being shaken to its core by a new technological breakthrough. This time, it's not TikTok, but Seedance 2.0, an AI video model developed by ByteDance, that is causing a stir in the film industry. Disney, one of the biggest players in the sector, has already approached ByteDance to explore this innovation. But what makes Seedance 2.0 so revolutionary and why is Hollywood so concerned?\n\nSeedance 2.0 is an AI tool that enables the creation of hyper-realistic videos with multiple shots in one. Imagine being able to upload a photo of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise and then have them engage in an epic fight scene on a rooftop. Or you could create a video of Mickey Mouse battling Thor. The possibilities are endless, and the quality of the videos is so high that it's nearly impossible to distinguish them from real videos.\n\nThe impact of Seedance 2.0 on the film industry is enormous. It has the potential to completely change the way films are made. Instead of lengthy and expensive shoots, filmmakers can now simply use an AI tool to create the desired scenes. This can not only significantly reduce production costs but also foster the creativity of filmmakers, as they can now experiment with scenes that would otherwise be impossible to film.\n\nHowever, technological advancement brings challenges. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for misuse. With Seedance 2.0, anyone, even without any film knowledge, can create hyper-realistic videos. This opens the door to deepfake videos and other forms of deception. Hollywood and other entertainment companies must be aware of these risks and take measures to prevent misuse.\n\nAnother challenge is the impact on employment in the film industry. As AI tools like Seedance 2.0 become more widely used, traditional film jobs, such as actors, directors, and camera operators, may become obsolete. This could lead to a significant change in the job market and the need for retraining and adaptation.\n\nDespite these challenges, Seedance 2.0 also offers enormous opportunities for innovation and growth. It can completely change the way we consume entertainment. Imagine being able to watch a personalized, custom-made film specifically for you, instead of going to a movie theater. This is no longer science fiction but a reality that is increasingly becoming a possibility.\n\nHollywood faces a crucial choice. They can embrace technological advancement and leverage the possibilities of Seedance 2.0 to elevate the film industry to new heights. Or they can try to hold back technological progress, which ultimately leads to falling behind and losing competitiveness. The choice is clear: embrace the future or fall behind.\n\nSeedance 2.0 is more than just an AI tool; it's a revolution in the film industry. It's an invitation to innovate, experiment, and push the boundaries of what's possible. Hollywood must rise to this challenge and shape the future of entertainment. The future is here, and it's brilliant.",

    "title": "Our Editors Love Wearing Jeans on the Plane—Yes, Really",
    "summary": "In the world of air travel, where comfort and style often clash, our editors have made an unexpected but welcome discovery: jeans. Yes, you read that right. Jeans, the timeless, versatile pant, is the unlikely hero of the modern air travel wardrobe. But why? And how have our editors brought this denim dream to life? Let's dive into the world of comfortable, stylish air travel with jeans.\n\nFirst and foremost, let's make one thing clear: not all jeans are created equal for air travel. It's about finding that perfect fit, the right material, and the ideal comfort levels. Our editors have spent hours researching, testing different brands and styles, and ultimately finding their favorite jeans that meet all the criteria. These are jeans that don't pinch, don't squeeze, and feel comfortable even after a long flight.\n\nOne of the key factors our editors considered was the fit. A too-tight fit can be uncomfortable and make you feel self-conscious, while a too-loose fit might not make you look as stylish. The perfect fit is one that is comfortable, allows for free movement, and looks good too. Our editors have found that a straight or slightly wide fit works best for air travel. This type of fit provides enough room for your legs to sit comfortably without feeling restricted.\n\nThe material of the jeans is another crucial factor. Our editors have discovered that jeans made from high-quality denim, which is slightly stretchy, work best. This type of denim provides enough support and comfort without feeling too stiff or too heavy. It's also important that the jeans breathe well so you don't get too hot during the flight. Our editors have noticed that jeans with a small percentage of elastane or spandex often work best because this makes the jeans slightly more stretchy and provides extra comfort.\n\nIn addition to the fit and material, our editors also looked at the style of the jeans. While comfort is key, you naturally want to look good too. Our editors have found that jeans in classic colors, such as blue, black, and gray, work best for air travel. These colors are versatile and can be easily combined with different outfits. They are also suitable for both more formal and informal occasions, depending on how you style them.\n\nAnother aspect our editors considered is the sustainability of the jeans. In an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly important, it's important to choose jeans that are not only comfortable and stylish but also eco-friendly. Our editors have discovered that there are more and more brands producing sustainable jeans, made from organic bleached denim or recycled material. These jeans are not only good for the environment but also offer the same level of comfort and style as traditional jeans.\n\nBut how do our editors actually wear their jeans on the plane? Let's take a look at a few of their favorite outfits. One of our editors loves to wear a pair of straight, blue jeans with a simple white t-shirt and a comfortable yet stylish jacket. This outfit is perfect for a long flight because it's comfortable but also looks good. Another editor prefers to wear a pair of black jeans with an elegant blouse and a light washed sweater. This outfit is perfect for a shorter flight or a business traveler who wants to wear something stylish but still comfortable.\n\nOur editors have also discovered that jeans are perfect for air travel because they can be easily refreshed. A pair of jeans can be simply folded and packed into a carry-on bag, giving you an extra outfit to hand. This is especially handy if you plan to go straight to an appointment or event after your flight. With a pair of jeans and a few different tops, you can create a number of different outfits, ensuring you're always stylish and comfortable, wherever you go.\n\nOf course, there are a few things to keep in mind when wearing jeans on the plane. First, make sure your jeans aren't too tight as this can be uncomfortable during a long flight. Second, choose jeans made from high-quality denim that breathe well so you don't get too hot. Third, choose a fit that is comfortable and allows for free movement. And finally, remember that style and comfort go hand in hand. You don't have to choose between the two; you can have both with the right jeans.\n\nIn conclusion, our editors have discovered that jeans are the perfect choice for air travel. Whether you're looking for comfort, style, or both, there's a pair of jeans out there that's perfect for you. With the right fit, the right material, and the right style, you can ensure you're comfortable and stylish, wherever you go. So, the next time you're traveling, consider packing a pair of jeans. You'll be surprised at how comfortable and stylish they can be.",

    "title": "Chinese river shows remarkable recovery after 70 years of decline",
    "summary": "The world-renowned Yangtze, the longest river in Asia and the third longest in the world, is showing significant signs of improvement. After seventy years of decline, the water quality of the river has significantly improved. This remarkable recovery is due to an effective fishing ban implemented by the Chinese government. The success of this initiative is a bright spot in the fight against environmental pollution and biodiversity loss. The Yangtze, which flows through three different climate zones and plays a crucial role in the lives of millions of people, has been a victim of industrialization and unsustainable agricultural practices for years. The river was heavily polluted by waste, chemicals, and heavy metals, leading to a dramatic decline in fish populations and a disrupted ecological balance. The fishing ban, which was introduced in 2003, was a radical but necessary measure to allow the river to recover. The ban covers an area of more than 70,000 square kilometers and includes over 400 species of fish. This has not only led to an increase in fish populations but also to an improvement in water quality and a restoration of ecological balance. Scientists have found that the concentration of heavy metals and chemicals in the water has decreased, while oxygen levels have increased. This has led to a recovery of water plants and animals, which in turn has contributed to improved water quality. The success of the fishing ban is not only due to the Chinese government but also to the local communities that have actively contributed to the protection of the river. Through educational programs and cooperation projects, local communities have been made aware of the importance of a healthy river and the role they can play in its preservation. The recovery of the Yangtze is a remarkable success story that hopes to inspire other rivers and waterways around the world. It shows that with the right measures and a combined effort of governments, scientists, and local communities, even the most polluted rivers can be restored. It is a bright spot in the fight against environmental pollution and biodiversity loss, and a beautiful example of how humans and nature can work together for a healthier future.",

    "title": "Asked my fiancée to marry me twice: a story of love and renewed commitment",
    "summary": "In a world full of traditions and conventions, the story of Jamie Evan Bichelman is a breath of fresh air. He has asked his fiancée not once, but twice, to marry him. An act that many people might consider unnecessary or even strange, but for Bichelman, it was a way to renew his love and commitment in a unique and meaningful way. Let's dive into his story, which is not only a story about repeating a proposal, but also about growth, self-improvement, and the power of love. Bichelman's story begins with a first proposal that, although it was a yes, wasn't quite perfect. There were factors that influenced the moment, such as the presence of unsupportive people and his own mental and physical health not being at its best. These factors made the moment, although it was a yes, not quite have the magical feeling he had hoped for. Bichelman describes how, while looking at the photos of that day, he sees the pain in his eyes and realizes that he and his fiancée deserve a second chance. A chance to create a moment that is entirely focused on their love, without the shadows of self-consciousness or unsupportive relationships. And so begins the plan for a second proposal. Two years later, after a period of growth and self-improvement, Bichelman decides to ask his fiancée to marry him again. This time, he chooses a location that is full of magic: Disneyland. It's a place that his fiancée has always loved, and it seems like the perfect location to celebrate their love. The day begins with a drive to Anaheim, California, with a bubbly Disney playlist as the soundtrack. They have a wonderful time at Disneyland, and within the magical confines of Main Street, USA, Bichelman goes down on one knee and renews his vow of love. He presents a piece of jewelry that matches the ring she already has, and they celebrate with a vegan meal surrounded by her favorite Disney characters. It's a day full of magic and love, and it's clear that the proposal wasn't necessary, but it was certainly worth it. It gives them even more beautiful memories to look back on, and it's a memory that is entirely about them and their love. Bichelman's story is a reminder that love and commitment can be expressed in different ways. It doesn't always have to be about a perfect moment, but about a moment that is meaningful to you and your partner. It's a story that challenges us to think about the traditions we follow and whether they really fit who we are and what we want. It's a story that shows us that it's okay to deviate from the norm, to find our own path, and to celebrate our love in our own way. And perhaps, like Bichelman, you'll find that a second proposal is exactly what you and your partner need to renew your love and commitment in a new and meaningful way.",

    "title": "Epstein Files: A List of People Facing Consequences Over the DOJ's Release",
    "summary": "The U.S. Department of Justice's release of over 3 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents has caused a new wave of backlash for people associated with the disgraced financier. The documents have revealed friendly communications with Epstein, even after his 2008 conviction for sex offenses. Some of the people who've experienced fallout exchanged crude messages about women, shared government secrets, or had a more expansive relationship with him than previously known. One high-profile entertainment industry executive said he wanted to see Ghislaine Maxwell in 'bondage gear' — well before any public accusation that she facilitated Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. It's not the first time the vast trove of documents, broadly known as the Epstein files, has had consequences for his associates. Last fall, the release of tens of thousands of Epstein's emails by the House Oversight Committee led to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor being stripped of his title as a British royal. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers took a leave from his teaching duties at Harvard University while the school investigates; he also resigned from OpenAI's board. Here are 10 people who've experienced consequences following the Justice Department's January 30 data dump. None of the people featured in this story has been accused of participating in Epstein's sex-trafficking scheme. Kathy Ruemmler, Goldman Sachs's chief legal officer, turned in her resignation following weeks of scrutiny over her communications with the convicted sex offender. June 30 will be her last day as the Wall Street bank's chief legal officer and general counsel, the bank said on Thursday. The DOJ's latest tranche of documents showed her offering Epstein advice on his legal troubles, including lawsuits brought by women accusing him of sexual abuse. She gushed over expensive gifts from him, including a $9,350 Hermes handbag, and referred to him in an email as 'Uncle Jeffrey.' She has previously said her relationship with the convicted sex offender was 'a professional association' and has expressed 'regret' over it. In the statement to Business Insider about her resignation, Ruemmler said it was her duty 'to put Goldman Sachs' interests first.' Brad Karp, a high-powered corporate lawyer, resigned as chairman of Paul Weiss, calling reports about his relationship with Epstein a 'distraction' for the white-shoe law firm. He also stepped down from the board of trustees of his alma mater, Union College. The documents include emails showing he worked with Epstein to surveil a woman in a dispute with one of Karp's clients. Business Insider has confirmed that the client was billionaire private equity titan Leon Black, who counted Epstein among his advisors. Karp also visited Epstein's Manhattan mansion and asked him to help his son get a job with director Woody Allen. Representatives for Paul Weiss declined to comment beyond their press release announcing Scott Barshay as the law firm's new chair. Peter Attia, a CBS News contributor and longevity expert, stepped down as the chief science officer of David Protein, a protein bar brand, and is no longer an adviser to the sleep technology company Eight Sleep. In the emails from the mid-2010s, Attia gives Epstein health advice that included crude remarks about women. In one email, he said a woman's genitalia was 'low carb.' In a social media post, he denied involvement in any criminal activity and said the emails were 'embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible.' Howard Lutnick, the U.S. Commerce Secretary, is facing bipartisan calls from lawmakers to resign after emails show he planned a visit to Epstein's island with his family in 2012. Lutnick previously said he severed ties with Epstein, his former Manhattan neighbor, after first meeting him in 2005. 'My wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,' Lutnick told the New York Post last year. Lawmakers asked Lutnick about the discrepancy on Tuesday at a prescheduled Senate hearing over broadband. He testified that he, his wife, and kids were at the island 'for an hour' for lunch. The DOJ's files show the two men exchanged calls in 2011 and invested in the same company around the time of the island visit. The White House has stood by Lutnick, with the Commerce Department saying: 'Mr. and Mrs. Lutnick met Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and had very limited interactions with him over the next 14 years.' Steve Tisch, owner of the New York Giants, exchanged numerous emails with Epstein about women in 2013, triggering a review by the National Football League. The emails show Epstein updating Tisch on the women, including their ages, nationalities, and 'working girl' status. After the emails were made public, he said he regretted associating with Epstein and that the women discussed in the emails were adults. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has said the league will review the communications and weigh whether they violate its personal conduct policies. Casey Wasserman announced on February 13 that he is selling his talent agency after his name appeared in the Epstein files, sparking a growing fallout. Soccer player Abby Wambach and singer Chapell Roan earlier said they were parting ways with Wasserman's agency. Wasserman flew on Epstein's jet with a group of people that included former President Bill Clinton. The files also show Wasserman and Ghislaine Maxwell exchanging racy and flirtatious emails in 2003, well before police began investigating Epstein, and over a decade before Maxwell's arrest on sex-trafficking charges in 2020. 'Casey - I will be coming back to NY torn late afternoon,' Maxwell wrote in one email. 'I shall be wearing a tight leather flying suit.' Wasserman said in a statement that he regretted his messages with Maxwell, which took place 'long before her horrific crimes came to light' and that he never had any personal or business relationship with Epstein. Wasserman announced his intentions to sell his agency in a memo to staffers, which the agency shared with Business Insider. 'I'm deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort. It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about,' Wasserman wrote. 'The pain experienced by the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell is unimaginable - and I'm glad, as I'm sure you all are, that those who helped them commit their crimes are rightly being held accountable.' Wasserman wrote that he had 'become a distraction.' 'That is why I have begun the process of selling the company, an effort that is already underway. During this time, Mike Watts will assume day-to-day control of the business while I devote my full attention to delivering Los Angeles an Olympic Games in 2028 that is worthy of this outstanding city,' he wrote. Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, shut down a charity she chaired following the Justice Department's document dump. A spokesperson for the foundation, called Sarah's Trust, said the decision was made after 'months' of discussion. The records show Ferguson sent warm emails to Epstein in 2009, when he was imprisoned for soliciting sex from a minor. She referred to him as the 'brother I have always wished for' and signed off another email with 'love you.' Ferguson previously said she regretted any association with Epstein. Representatives for Ferguson didn't respond to requests for comment. Peter Mandelson quit his job as the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States, and left the British Labour Party itself, after the Epstein files showed him providing sensitive government information to the convicted sex offender. The emails, dating back to Mandelson's time in senior posts under former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, show him informing Epstein about a change in tax rules, the sale of government assets during a UK financial crisis, and a European Union bailout of Greece's economy. The records also show Epstein sent money to Mandelson's husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva. London's Metropolitan Police said it's investigating Mandelson over the emails appearing to leak financial information to Epstein. Mandelson has denied any illegal activity and told The Times of London that his husband accepting the funds from Epstein reflected 'a lapse in our collective judgment.' Morgan McSweeney resigned as the chief of staff for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over Mandelson, whom he recommended for the ambassadorship job. 'I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice,' McSweeney said in a statement upon his resignation on Sunday. 'In public life responsibility must be owned when it matters most, not just when it is most convenient. In the circumstances, the only honourable course is to step aside.' Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem was replaced as chairman and CEO of Dubai-based logistics firm DP World on February 13, after emails between the Emirati executive and Epstein were published by the Justice Department. DP World, which is owned by Dubai's royal family, is one of the world's largest logistics companies and runs Jebel Ali, the largest port in the Middle East. The company did not mention bin Sulaymen in its statement announcing a leadership transition, but said that Essa Kazim and Yuvraj Narayan would take on his roles as chairman and CEO, respectively. Emails published by the Justice Department show that Epstein referred to bin Sulayem as his 'close personal friend' in a 2010 email. In an email to Epstein in 2015, bin Sulayem said that a girl he met 'two years ago' who went to the American University in Dubai was 'the best sex I ever had amazing body.' Representatives at DP World did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.",

    "title": "When retirement is 19 credit cards and $40,000 in debt away - Susan Cannon is struggling to pay off her credit card debt due to the high interest rates.",
    "summary": "Susan Cannon is backed against the wall. The 73-year-old widow from Texas has 19 credit cards with a total debt of $39,440. The interest rates vary from 12.15% to 34.99%. 'I can't get the balance down because I am still having to use credit cards at the end of the month to get groceries and gas,' says Cannon. She pays her bills, but due to the high interest rates, the debt keeps growing. 'I feel like I'm being gouged.'\n\nCannon has worked hard her entire life. She started her career as a medical coder and later worked for Coca-Cola and as an accountant. After retiring in 2015, she worked part-time as a mystery shopper. But when the pandemic hit, she lost that job. Since then, she has lived off her social security, her pension, and minimal COVID relief. Credit cards helped her stay afloat, but the high interest rates made it difficult to pay off the debt.\n\nCannon hopes that a cap on interest rates will help her. President Donald Trump recently proposed capping credit card interest rates at 10%. Cannon believes this would make a significant difference for her. She has already contacted some banks to lower her interest rates, but to no avail. She recently received a denial letter from CitiBank, where she has an interest rate of 28.49%.\n\nInterest rates on credit cards have been rising over the past decade. The average stands at nearly 23% annually, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, says that credit card companies are 'incredible profit machines' that attract consumers with specific products. 'Those cards benefit from having a consumer who's captive to using that card in that store to get that deal,' says Rust. 'And so perhaps it's not surprising that interest rates are frequently higher as a result.'\n\nCannon has always made sure to pay at least the minimum monthly payment on her credit cards to keep from falling too far behind. She uses her social security check to cover about half of her bills, and at the end of each month, she finds herself transferring some money from her savings account into her checking account to cover the remainder of her expenses. This leaves her with just enough to pay slightly more than those minimum credit card payments, but nothing extra. 'I have tried to keep up with these credit cards, and I still am,' says Cannon. 'I feel like a fool, but at the same time, I wouldn't be in this situation if they hadn't raised those interest rates.'\n\nCredit card interest rates are a rare issue that has garnered bipartisan agreement. The 2009 CARD Act required companies to notify customers of interest rate increases at least 45 days in advance and placed restrictions on actions such as late fees and withdrawal fees. However, the legislation did not cap interest rates or rate increases. That's why there's been a renewed push to cap interest rates. Trump called for a one-year, 10% cap on rates in early January, saying in a Truth Social post that he would 'no longer let the American Public be ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more.\n\nMore recently, over 55 organizations, including the Consumer Federation of America and the NAACP, called on House and Senate lawmakers to pass bipartisan legislation that would cap credit card interest rates at 10% for 5 years. Research from Vanderbilt University found that the proposal could save $100 billion a year. Credit card companies have pushed back on the proposed caps. A coalition of banking groups said in a joint statement in response to Trump's proposal that a 10% cap 'would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help. If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.'\n\nJamie Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO, said on a recent earnings call that capping credit card rates could limit access to credit for customers with lower credit scores. Those more costly alternatives include payday loans, which tend to charge high interest rates and fees that can be a lot more difficult for consumers to escape than credit cards, Rust said. SoFi's CEO, Anthony Noto, said his company is prepared to extend personal loans to consumers, should a credit-card cap be implemented.\n\n'Relying on credit cards is expensive, but it's important not to forget that they still come with protections,' Rust said. 'They still cost less than a payday lender. It's still easier to resolve a problem with your credit card company than with a buy now, pay later company.'\n\nCannon makes up just a sliver of the $1.28 trillion in credit card debt in the US, and she acknowledges that other people have it worse than her. It doesn't make her situation less painful. She physically cannot work multiple jobs, and if she put all of her money toward her credit cards, she wouldn't be able to maintain her property and afford her basic needs. 'I never thought I would be in this position,' Cannon said. 'I'm just surviving.'",

    "title": "Can a computer-animated film win an Oscar for Best Costume Design?",
    "summary": "The Oscar for Best Costume Design is one of the most prestigious awards in the film industry. It celebrates the art of designing and creating costumes that bring the characters and the world of a film to life. Traditionally, we think of films like 'Wicked', 'Cruella', and 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' in this category, where we encounter real, handmade outfits that are often museum-worthy. However, in the recent course of the film industry, a new player has emerged on the scene: computer-animated films. One of the most notable examples is 'Avatar: Fire and Ash', which has been nominated this year for Best Costume Design. This raises the question: is it fair for a computer-animated film to be considered for this prestigious award? To answer this question, we first need to understand what costume design entails and how it is judged by the Academy. Costume design is not just about creating beautiful clothing pieces but also about telling a story through color, style, and texture. It is about creating a visual identity for the characters that helps the viewer understand and experience the world of the film. In traditional films, these costumes are handmade, often with the help of historical and cultural references. This requires a tremendous amount of research, creativity, and craftsmanship. On the other hand, in computer-animated films, these costumes are digitally designed and animated. This requires a different set of skills, including knowledge of 3D modeling, texturing, and rendering. Although the process differs, the goal is the same: to create a visually appealing and meaningful costume design that contributes to the overall storytelling of the film. The question then is whether the Academy is capable of fairly judging these different forms of costume design. Some argue that computer-animated films have an advantage because they are not limited by the physical constraints of real fabrics and materials. They can create costumes that are impossible to make by hand, allowing them to present unique and innovative designs. On the other hand, traditional films can boast the authenticity and handmade quality of their costumes, representing a different form of art and craftsmanship. It is important to note that the Academy has long recognized computer-animated films in various categories, such as Best Animated Film and Best Visual Effects. It is therefore not unthinkable that they can also give a fair assessment in the Best Costume Design category. Moreover, with the advent of new technologies and the continuous evolution of the film industry, it is essential that the Academy adapts and recognizes new forms of art and creativity. It is an opportunity to push the boundaries of what is possible in the film industry and to celebrate the diversity and innovation within the art of costume design. In conclusion, the nomination of 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' for the Oscar for Best Costume Design is an important milestone in the evolution of the film industry. It raises important questions about the future of costume design and how we can appreciate different forms of art and creativity. Whether it is handmade costumes or digitally animated designs, the most important thing is that they contribute to the storytelling of the film and immerse the viewer in the world of the characters. The Academy has the responsibility to fairly judge and recognize these different forms of art and thus celebrate the ongoing innovation and creativity within the film industry.",

In a move that is both notable and strategic, Apple Music has taken Spotify's price increase to task, creating an interesting dynamic in the competition between the two giants. Apple Music's reaction is not only a commentary on the price increase but also a reflection of the larger battle for market share and customer loyalty in the music streaming industry. For users, this means they may need to look for alternatives or adjust their budgets to continue streaming their favorite music. For companies, it means they need to rethink their strategies to compete in an increasingly competitive market. Apple Music's action to make Spotify's price increase ridiculous is a clear signal that the battle for supremacy in the music streaming world is far from over. It is a reminder of the power of social media as a platform for companies to spread their message and challenge competitors. It is also a reminder of the power of the consumer, who ultimately decides which service best meets their needs and budget. In a world where music streaming services are becoming an increasingly integral part of our daily lives, it is important to stay informed about these developments and the impact they have on our listening habits and budgets. Apple Music's action is a notable moment in the history of the music streaming industry and a reminder of the ongoing battle for market share and customer loyalty. It is a moment that both users and companies will not forget, and that will shape the future of the industry. In the coming months and years, we will likely see more of such interactions between Spotify and Apple Music, and it is exciting to see how these two giants respond to the challenges and opportunities that the future brings. For now, enjoy your favorite music and be aware of the dynamics unfolding behind the scenes of the music streaming industry.",

    "title": "Valve improves Steam reviews with PC specifications: A game-changing update for players and developers",
    "summary": "In the world of gaming, player feedback is invaluable. Steam reviews have long been a platform where gamers share their experiences and opinions about games. However, until now, a crucial element was missing: the ability to mention your computer specifications. This has now changed thanks to an update from Valve, the creators of Steam. This new feature allows players to add their hardware configuration to their reviews, providing a more detailed and useful overview of games. This is a game-changing update that benefits both players and game developers. Let's delve deeper into this improvement and its impact on the gaming community. The experience of a game is heavily dependent on the hardware it is played on. A game that runs smoothly and looks great on a high-end PC can be slow and unpleasant on a lower configuration. Until now, players could share their experiences, but without information about their hardware, it was difficult to understand the context of their reviews. With Valve's new update, players can now add their PC specifications to their reviews. This means that other players can see which hardware was used when writing a review, giving them a better idea of how a game will perform on their own system. This is especially useful for players with lower specifications who want to know if a game will run well on their system. For game developers, this information is equally important. They can now better understand how their games perform on different hardware configurations and can optimize their games for a wider range of systems. This can lead to better performance and an improved user experience for all players. The impact of this update is already noticeable. Players are excited about the ability to share their hardware configuration and find it useful to see what specifications other players have. This leads to more informative and reliable reviews, ultimately benefiting the gaming community. It is a step towards more transparency and better information for everyone involved. In addition to the practical benefits, this update also has a positive impact on the gaming community. It encourages players to write more detailed and useful reviews, improving the quality of feedback on Steam. It also helps new players make better decisions about which games to buy, based on reviews that better match their hardware configuration. This contributes to a more informed and reliable gaming community. Valve's update is an example of how small changes can have a big impact. By adding a simple but effective feature to Steam reviews, Valve has improved the way players give and receive feedback. This is a step towards a more transparent and informative gaming community, ultimately leading to a better experience for all players. It is a great example of how community feedback can lead to improvements that benefit everyone. In conclusion, the addition of PC specifications to Steam reviews is a significant step forward for the gaming community. It provides players with more context and information, helps developers improve their games, and contributes to a better user experience for everyone. It is an update that is both practical and positive and will forever change the way we talk about and review games. Let's hope this is just the beginning of more improvements that benefit the gaming community.",

    "summary": "In the early hours of January 9th, Europe was struck by one of the most powerful winter storms of the decade. Storm Goretti, a cyclone with wind gusts of up to 110 miles per hour, brought large parts of the continent to a standstill. Airports were closed, trains halted, and streets were flooded. But amidst the chaos and destruction, there was a story of hope and rescue that would touch the world. A story about a small, yet mighty survivor: a young loggerhead turtle that had been blown hundreds of miles off course by the fierce winds of the storm. This is the story of how an airline and a team of veterinarians worked together to save a life and give VIP status to an endangered turtle. \n\nThe story began when a beachcomber on the Island of Jersey, near the coast of France, found a small, exhausted turtle washed up on the shore. The turtle, later identified as a young loggerhead, was clearly in distress. He was hypothermic, dehydrated, and had clearly suffered from the force of the storm. The beachcomber, quickly realizing that this was an endangered species, took the turtle to the nearest animal sanctuary, where a team of veterinarians took him under their wing. \n\nThe turtle, quickly dubbed 'VIP' due to the special care he required, was immediately taken to a specialized animal clinic. There, he was examined and treated for hypothermia, dehydration, and several minor injuries. The veterinarians were amazed by the resilience of the small turtle, who, despite everything he had been through, was still fighting to survive. \n\nBut the VIP turtle's journey was far from over. To transport him to a more suitable rehabilitation center, air travel was necessary. And that's where an airline stepped in. The airline, known for its commitment to animal welfare, decided to transport the turtle for free. They assembled a team of employees to ensure that the turtle could board safely and comfortably and receive the best care during the flight. \n\nThe VIP turtle was placed in a special, ventilated box and boarded the plane. During the flight, he was constantly monitored by a veterinarian who traveled with him. The airline also ensured that the turtle received the best treatment, including a special diet and medical care. \n\nAfter a safe flight, the VIP turtle arrived at his destination. He was handed over to a team of experts who would help him recover and eventually return to his natural habitat. The turtle, now a symbol of hope and resilience, has been given a new chance at life thanks to the efforts of an airline, a team of veterinarians, and a beachcomber who found him. \n\nThis story is a reminder of the power of collaboration and the importance of animal welfare. It also shows that even in times of chaos and destruction, there is always hope. And sometimes, that hope comes in the form of a small, yet mighty turtle that has been blown hundreds of miles off course by a storm, but is still fighting to survive. The VIP turtle is now a symbol of hope and resilience for many, and his story will be told for a long time to come.",

    "title": "From Wealth to Health: The Transformative Story of Tyler Smith",
    "summary": "In the world of entrepreneurship and financial success, much is said about the freedom that wealth brings. Tyler Smith, the founder of SkySlope, a real estate software company valued at $80 million in a 2017 sale, lived this lifestyle. He was proud of the fact that he only slept three hours a night because he worked so much. But everything changed when he discovered that his biological age was 47, the same year his father died at the age of 47 from a heart attack. This was a wake-up call for Smith, who decided to change his life and focus on health and wellness. He invested more than $1 million in a home wellness center and founded Hundred Health, a company focused on health and wellness. In this article, we share the transformative story of Tyler Smith, from wealth to health. Tyler Smith grew up in a time when subprime mortgage credit was easily obtainable. At the age of 19, he bought a house, which gave him a sense of responsibility and made him think about his future career. He was impressed by the commission his real estate agent earned and decided he could earn more by doing good work in the real estate sector. Smith dropped out of college to focus entirely on real estate. During the financial crisis, he found a niche in helping banks sell foreclosed homes. In 2006 and 2007, he oversaw about 1,000 home sales a year and managed triple that number of properties. He worked 14-hour days, seven days a week. It wasn't a good lifestyle, but he was young enough to get away with it. He fueled himself with energy drinks and embraced the fact that work was his life. To scale his business, he developed software to track his business's transactions. Other brokerages inquired about what he was using, and soon he had clients paying $2,000 or $5,000 a month to use the software. He was in the right place at the right time with the right product as real estate transactions went digital. By 2012, his software, SkySlope, was doing $12 million in annual revenue. In 2017, Fidelity bought a majority stake, valuing the company at more than $80 million. Smith had enough money to never work again, but he was determined to use his financial freedom to focus on something with a purpose: a mission-driven business. When he was 39, he underwent a biological age test, which showed that his biological age was 47. This was a shock to him, as his father had died at the age of 47 from a heart attack. The test showed him that what he was telling himself wasn't true. He worked out and ate relatively healthy, but the data showed that what was happening inside his body didn't match what was on the outside. Smith invested more than $1 million in building a home wellness center. He hired a top-notch healthcare team and rented a 2,000 square-foot unit in Sacramento, which he transformed into his own personal wellness center. It had IV infusions, a hyperbaric chamber, a red light bed, cold plunges, massagers - basically anything you can name in the health and fitness world. He and his wife spent about $700,000 fitting out the Sacramento space, and eventually over $1 million building the wellness center in their home. Today, he uses the red light bed, oxygen therapy, and cold plunge almost daily. Other therapies, like massagers and bikes, didn't make the final cut. He loves the results of the hyperbaric chamber, but doesn't like lying in it for an hour, so for now, that's out of rotation. Smith changed everything about his health and fitness, and because of that, everything in his life changed: his muscle mass and energy levels went through the roof, and his mood improved. He felt better than ever, and friends began to notice. He knows that not everyone has the money and access he does. Most people have more data about their health than ever due to smart watches and wearable monitors, but they don't have a team of doctors helping them use that information. He started Hundred Health not only to provide data, but also to offer a personalized plan for what to do with it. He used to think that wealth was freedom, but now he knows that health is - and he would like to help more people access that. Read the original article on Business Insider.",

    "title": "Gary Marcus calls out viral AI essay as alarmist 'hype'",
    "summary": "AI researcher Gary Marcus said it's unlikely AI will begin to replace jobs in the next one to two years. Marcus, who on X criticized the essay by entrepreneur and investor Matt Shumer as having 'not a shred of actual data,' accused the essay's contents of being alarmist in an interview with Business Insider. 'Hyped-up views have gotten us into a bad place, possibly one that's going to lead to a serious economic recession or something like that,' Marcus told Business Insider. 'And I guess I think that one should work from the facts rather than just trying to cause an alarm.' In his essay titled 'Something Big is Happening,' Shumer, whose past startup sells a subscription-based AI-assisted writing tool, warned that AI would upend not just software engineering, but most jobs done 'on a screen.' Shumer also has a small VC fund. Marcus said that while AI will replace some labor and affect jobs, the process will be much slower than what Shumer and others are describing. AI can do some things well and help speed up work, but it's just not near the point of replacing humans, Marcus said. 'AI can do a small subset of the tasks, and that sometimes speeds up human beings and things like that, but it rarely does all of what a human being can do in any particular domain,' he told Business Insider. 'This will change over time, just to be clear. It is likely that AI will replace most human labor over the next century, but it's not likely that it will over the next year or two.' Companies that move too quickly to replace jobs with AI are likely to find themselves in a similar position as Klarna, Marcus said. In 2024, Klarna touted an AI assistant that could do the equivalent work of 700 people. By May 2025, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, long a proponent of AI, said that 'as cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality.' He added that 'investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.' 'Six months or a year later, they come back with their tails between their legs because it turns out that the AI systems don't do things as well as the human,' Marcus said. 'So, I'm not saying that there's nothing going on. I'm not saying that there's no value in these AI systems, but they're premature.' Klarna told Business Insider that the number of its customer service queries handled by AI has increased 'as it gets better at more complex requests,' and the company 'has not reversed or scaled back its AI strategy.' Marcus said that the more likely outcome in the short-term is not that AI will replace junior employees but rather that executives think it's capable of doing so — and make what could ultimately prove to be a costly gamble. 'The biggest thing I think junior people have to worry about right now is a misapprehension by the C-suite that these techniques work better than they actually do,' Marcus said. As of Friday morning, Shumer's post has been viewed more than 80 million times on X alone. In a Substack post expanding on his criticisms, Marcus called Shumer's post 'weaponized hype.' 'The general impression that he conveys is basically that the sky is falling now, and at most, I think what's really happening is the junior people are under some threat, and I think that threat is actually exaggerated,' Marcus told Business Insider. Shumer previously told Business Insider that he wrote his essay in part to reach people like his dad, who may be skeptical or avoid AI entirely. He felt compelled to warn them about what might be on the horizon, even 'if there's just a 20% chance of it happening.' Marcus's biggest critique of Shumer's post is that it doesn't take into account current data and research showing that AI still has a long way to go, and that it didn't present the full context behind a famous Model Evaluation & Threat Research graph assessing AI progress. He said that other studies, including a June 2025 paper published by Apple's Machine Learning Research Group, found limitations in what current models can do. Marcus also said that many leading AI CEOs who have made bold predictions about the future of work have failed to deliver on past ones. He points to xAI CEO Elon Musk's frequent rosy outlook on the number of robotaxis Tesla will put on the road (Musk once said one million by 2020) and to Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton's 2016 statement that the world should stop training radiologists. (Last May, Hinton told The New York Times that his prediction was poorly worded and that while he was wrong on the timeline, the general direction for AI's capabilities in radiology was correct.) 'What they have all learned to do is to sell the rosiest picture possible, and the media rarely calls them out,' Marcus told Business Insider. On Thursday, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman made waves by predicting that most, if not all, white-collar tasks could be automated within the next year and a half. One of the industries Suleyman mentioned is accounting. Marcus isn't convinced. 'Think about accounting in particular,' he told Business Insider. 'Even one mistake can cost a client hundreds of thousands of dollars or get them sent to jail or whatever. Accounting is a business that is built on accuracy. If you're not accurate, you don't have a business.'",

    "title": "Meta's Ray-Ban Glasses: A Revolution in Technology or a Privacy Nightmare?",
    "summary": "Meta, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, is on the verge of adding a new feature to their Ray-Ban Smart Glasses: facial recognition. This news, reported by The New York Times, has sparked a wave of reactions, both positive and negative. But what does this really mean for us as consumers and how will it change our interaction with technology?\n\nThe Ray-Ban Smart Glasses, launched in 2021, have already gained enormous popularity. EssilorLuxottica, the owner of Ray-Ban, reported that sales tripled in 2025, indicating a high demand for these smart glasses. The glasses combine style with functionality, allowing users to take photos, record videos, and capture audio with a simple voice command. But the possibility of facial recognition adds a new level of complexity.\n\nFacial recognition is a sensitive topic, especially regarding privacy. There have already been rumors that Harvard students in 2024 modified the glasses to perform facial recognition by sending photos to a third party for scanning. Meta has always emphasized that the glasses themselves cannot perform facial recognition, but this news suggests they might be planning to add this feature.\n\nAn internal memo from Meta's Reality Labs, which develops hardware including smart glasses, suggests that the company plans to launch the feature during a 'dynamic political environment'. This implies that Meta thinks people will be too distracted by other events to worry about privacy issues. This is a controversial approach and has already drawn criticism.\n\nBut what are the benefits of facial recognition in smart glasses? One advantage is enhanced security. Imagine being able to use your glasses to open your front door or gain access to secure areas. It can also be useful for people with disabilities, helping them navigate their environment better. Additionally, it can help identify people in distress, potentially saving lives.\n\nOf course, there are also concerns. Privacy is a major issue. Who has access to the data? How is it secured? And what happens if the data is hacked? These questions need to be answered before we embrace this technology. Moreover, there is the risk of misuse. Facial recognition can be used for mass surveillance, casting a shadow over civil rights.\n\nMeta has said they will 'take a thoughtful approach' before rolling out anything. This is a positive sign, as it suggests they are taking public concerns seriously. But it remains to be seen whether they will take sufficient measures to safeguard privacy.\n\nThe launch of this feature could be a turning point in how we use technology. It could open the door to new applications that we can't even imagine yet. But it is also a reminder that technology always has two faces: it can improve our lives, but it can also bring new challenges. It is up to us as consumers to stay informed and to demand that companies take responsibility.\n\nIn the meantime, the Ray-Ban Smart Glasses remain a popular product, and the possibility of facial recognition adds a new chapter to their story. Whether this chapter will have a happy ending depends on how Meta handles the challenges ahead. One thing is certain: the future of technology is here, and it's time to be ready for it.",

    "title": "Shocking Testimonies in Alexander Brothers Trial: Woman Sexually Assaulted in Hamptons Hot Tub as Partygoers Watch",
    "summary": "In the sex trafficking trial against the Alexander brothers in New York, nine women have already shared their shocking experiences. This week, jurors heard about an alleged assault at a Hamptons pool party. According to testimonies, a woman was sexually assaulted in a hot tub while partygoers watched and no one came to her aid. The brothers Tal and Oren Alexander, former luxury real estate brokers, are on trial along with their brother Alon. The witnesses, including Avishan Bodjnoud, an information manager at the United Nations, described how the woman, who was drunk and screaming for help, repeatedly asked them to stop. Bodjnoud said she asked for help from the bystanders, but no one intervened. She felt too afraid and alone to call the police and eventually fled the party in a taxi. Before leaving, she wrote 'Rapists' and 'You need to apologize' on the front door and wall of the Southampton rental with eyeliner. Photos of the graffiti, which were found on Tal Alexander's hard drive, were shown in court. Bodjnoud said she hoped the photos could one day be used as evidence. The testimonies took place during the third week of the federal trial against the brothers. So far, nine accusers have testified, describing how they were assaulted behind closed doors by one or more of the brothers, including on a cruise ship, at two Hamptons rentals, and at an Aspen ski resort. The hot tub incident stands out as the only alleged assault to take place in public view, with a pool party in full swing. It is not clear whether prosecutors will call the woman herself to the stand or whether she was ever identified. The brothers' lawyers argue that any sexual contact was consensual and not trafficking. During the examination of witnesses, the lawyers repeatedly pointed out that none of the women called the police or took a drug test that could substantiate their claims of being drugged. During the cross-examination of Bodjnoud, a lawyer for Tal Alexander argued that she remained silent out of fear for the brothers' power and influence. 'Were you aware that in 2009, Tal Alexander was a 21-year-old copy machine salesman?' asked the lawyer Milton Williams. A second witness to the alleged hot tub assault, who testified under the pseudonym Isa Brooks, said she saw 'a girl, I believe, in a green bikini with a bunch of guys on top of her.' She said she heard another woman, who was also indoors looking out into the yard, cry out, 'I work for the UN and I know what you're doing!' Oren Alexander, who was outside, slammed the door in that woman's face, Brooks testified. Brooks was called to testify to her own alleged assault, which she said took place earlier in the day on that same Saturday. She was days away from her 17th birthday. She described struggling and falling in and out of consciousness as Tal Alexander and Alon Alexander, whom she described as the 'quieter twin,' joined with two other men in violently assaulting her on a bed. The four men were saying 'degrading words' during the attack, Brooks told the jury. 'I was wondering why they hated me,' she recalled thinking. During cross-examination, Brooks was questioned by the defense about photographs showing her celebrating her 17th birthday with school pals days after the incident, and was asked why, days after that, she and a girlfriend stayed overnight at another Hamptons home where Tal Alexander was also present. 'I was scared to rock the boat,' she responded of her reluctance to speak out or call the authorities. The brothers face up to life in prison if convicted of a top count of sex trafficking conspiracy.",

    "title": "Goodbye, New York: Why Bethenny Frankel says Miami is the 'new LA'",
    "summary": "Bethenny Frankel, a name synonymous with the glitz and glamour of 'The Real Housewives of New York City,' has made a notable move. In 2025, she left the bustling streets of New York for the sun-drenched coast of South Florida. Her reasoning? 'Miami is the new LA.' This statement is not just a personal preference but a reflection of a broader trend among wealthy Americans leaving cultural hubs like New York and LA for smaller cities such as Miami. Frankel, now 55, shares her insights with Business Insider, and her words are a testament to the transformation Miami is undergoing. 'In the way that LA was the cool place to be, and aspirational people wanted to be there,' she says. This move is not just a relocation of people but a shift of cultural and economic power. A Bank of America Institute study from January 2026 revealed that New York experienced the second-largest population loss of any US city in the fourth quarter of 2025, after Los Angeles. Approximately 45% of New Yorkers who left chose a southern destination, with Miami alone accounting for 7% of departures. Frankel emphasizes that, while New York is still cool, Miami and Florida, in general, offer a new, exciting dynamic. The allure of Miami goes beyond just the pleasant weather. It's also a magnetic center for wealth and luxury. The Miami metro area currently has the most million-dollar listings in the US, a title traditionally reserved for New York. More than a quarter of the demand in the Miami metro region originates from the New York metro area, according to Realtor.com's December 2025 Luxury Housing Report. This influx of wealth has changed Miami's cultural landscape, says Frankel. 'It means shopping, art, nightlife, the real-estate cool factor,' she explains. 'Everybody went where the money is. The money is dictating what's happening on social media and what's cool.' This shift is not only visible in the luxury market but also in the social media world. Business Insider's Lucia Moses reported in December that Miami is emerging as a hub for social media influencers. The city has the highest number of top Instagram creators per capita of any US city, ahead of New York and LA. Florida's draw in recent years has extended beyond just billionaires and social media influencers. Differences in tax policy and cost of living mean that someone earning $150,000 a year could save roughly $50,000 annually by moving from New York City to Miami, largely due to Florida's lack of state income tax. For Frankel, the move offers more than financial benefits. It has made her 'more social' and allowed her to run her businesses from the 'sunniest and most beautiful-weathered place.' While Florida has drawn in large numbers of domestic migrants since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Miami has begun to hemorrhage residents. The Bank of America Institute study found that Miami recorded the third-largest domestic population decline among US cities in the fourth quarter of 2025, with many residents relocating to more affordable parts of Florida, including Orlando and Tampa. For Frankel, the entire state is having a moment. 'Delray, Palm Beach, Boca, Miami, the Design District,' she says. 'Florida is on fire.' These moves and changes are not just a trend but a testament to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of American society and economy. Miami, with its unique blend of culture, luxury, and social media influence, is poised to usher in a new chapter as the new cultural and economic epicenter for America's rich and famous.",

    "summary": "Thursday, July 21, 2022, was a historic day for European spaceflight. The most powerful version of the Ariane 6 rocket, developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), was launched for the first time from the spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. This launch marks a significant moment in the history of European spaceflight, not only because of the technological achievements but also because of the strategic partnership with American tech giant Amazon. \n\nThe Ariane 6 is designed to play a crucial role in the future of European spaceflight. With a capacity to bring heavy loads into space, this rocket is a direct competitor to the American Falcon 9 from SpaceX and the Delta IV Heavy from United Launch Alliance. The launch on Thursday was a demonstration of the strength and reliability of the Ariane 6, carrying 32 satellites for Amazon's internet network, Project Kuiper. \n\nProject Kuiper is an ambitious initiative by Amazon to create a global internet network using a constellation of satellites. This project aims to provide internet access to remote and underdeveloped areas around the world. The launch of the Ariane 6 with the Kuiper satellites is a significant milestone for Amazon, as it brings them closer to their goal of building a reliable and fast internet network. \n\nThe successful launch of the Ariane 6 is also a sign of the strong collaboration between European and American companies in the space sector. This collaboration is essential for the future of spaceflight, as it provides access to advanced technologies and expertise. It is an example of how international cooperation can lead to innovation and progress in spaceflight. \n\nFor ESA, the launch of the Ariane 6 is an important step in maintaining European independence in spaceflight.
