    "title": "Anthropic's CEO: We're in the 'centaur phase' of software engineering",
    "summary": "Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has made a notable comparison to describe the collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence (AI). He likens it to the mythological creature, the centaur, a combination of human and horse. This comparison is not only poetic but also technically relevant, as it reflects the current phase of software development where human engineers and AI work together to achieve better results.\n\nIn a recent interview on the podcast \"Interesting Times with Ross Douthat,\" Amodei elaborates on his stance. He uses the example of chess to make his point. Fifteen to twenty years ago, a human checking an AI's output could beat an AI or a human player alone. Now, AI can beat humans without that human oversight. This transition, Amodei says, is also applicable to software engineering. \"We're already in our centaur phase for software,\" he states. \"During that centaur phase, if anything, the demand for software engineers may go up. But the period may be very brief.\"\n\nAmodei is, however, concerned about the \"big disruption\" that entry-level white-collar work might undergo. He warns that this change is not comparable to previous economic revolutions, such as the shift from agriculture to factory work to knowledge work, which took place over centuries or decades. \"This is happening over a number of years,\" he says.\n\nAmodei is one of the most prominent voices warning that AI could displace some white-collar jobs, particularly in law, finance, and consulting. In a January essay, he predicted that AI could disrupt 50% of entry-level jobs within one to five years. Other leaders of top AI labs, such as Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis, have made similar comments about advanced AI automating service jobs within the next 18 months.\n\nDespite these warnings, there are also positive voices. Execs at some software companies argue that AI will boost engineer productivity and that companies will need more of them. \"The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,\" said GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke in a July podcast. \"I think the idea that AI without any coding skills lets you just build a billion-dollar business is mistaken.\" Atlassian's CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes added that while AI advances, people will keep coming up with new ideas for the technology they want, and engineers will be needed to build it. \"Five years from now, we'll have more engineers working for our company than we do today,\" he said in an October interview. \"They will be more efficient, but technology creation is not output-bound.\"\n\nThese developments show that while AI will have a significant impact on the job market, it will also create new opportunities and growth possibilities. It is a transition that needs to be carefully managed to ensure that the benefits of AI are optimized and the negative effects are minimized. The future of software engineering seems to be one where human creativity and AI efficiency will go hand in hand, much like the centaur, a symbiotic relationship that will challenge and expand the boundaries of what is possible.",

This expansion of their product line is strategic, as it can further democratize the market for autonomous vehicles. However, the competition is fierce, with U.S. companies like Tesla and Waymo, as well as Chinese competitors such as BYD and XPeng. Despite the challenges, Rivian remains focused on innovation and growth. The recent drop in stock price after the earnings release, followed by a rise in after-hours trading, reflects the market's volatility but also the potential for long-term success. Scaringe's vision goes beyond just the ability to drive themselves; he aims for vehicles that can perform routine tasks such as shopping or ordering spare parts. This ambition underscores the potential of autonomous technology to transform daily life. As the world looks towards a future where self-driving cars are the norm, Rivian remains a key player in this revolution. Their continuous innovation and growth are a sign of the excitement and potential of the autonomous vehicle sector. The road to 2030 will bring challenges, but with companies like Rivian leading the way, the future of self-driving cars seems not only possible but inevitable.",

    "summary": "In an era where the world grapples with various health challenges, a ray of hope emerges from India. The country, which recently experienced a mini-outbreak of the Nipah virus, is on the brink of a potential breakthrough in the treatment of this often-fatal disease. For the first time in history, clinical trials for a Nipah virus vaccine are beginning, marking a significant step forward in the fight against this public health threat.\n\nThe Nipah virus, which is spread through contact between humans and animals, has a high fatality rate and has caused panic in communities where it has broken out in the past. Until now, there has been little that doctors could do for the victims other than normal supportive care procedures such as treating the resulting symptoms, rest, and hydration. The absence of specialized treatment has only heightened the need for a vaccine.\n\nThe clinical trials for the Nipah virus vaccine are the result of years of research and development. Scientists and researchers have worked tirelessly to develop an effective vaccine that has the potential to save lives and prevent outbreaks. The commencement of these trials marks a crucial milestone in medical science and offers hope for the future.\n\nThe Nipah virus is a rare but serious disease that was first identified in Malaysia in 1998. Since then, there have been several outbreaks in different parts of the world, particularly in South Asia. The disease is transmitted by bats and pigs and can also be spread from person to person, making it difficult to control. The symptoms of the Nipah virus range from mild to severe and can include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and in severe cases, coma and death.\n\nThe development of a vaccine against the Nipah virus is a complex and challenging task. It requires an in-depth understanding of the virus and the way it attacks the human body. Researchers have explored various strategies, including the use of weakened or killed viruses, genetic technologies, and designing vaccines that specifically target the proteins of the virus. The clinical trials will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and determine if it can be used to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe commencement of clinical trials for the Nipah virus vaccine is a significant step forward, but it is important to remember that the development process of a vaccine is long and complex. It can take years before the vaccine is available to the general public, and there are still many obstacles to overcome. Despite these challenges, the commencement of the trials offers hope and inspiration to those grappling with the impact of the Nipah virus.\n\nThe international community has recognized the need for a Nipah virus vaccine and has provided support to the researchers and scientists working on the front lines. Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) have emphasized the need for a vaccine and have allocated resources to support its development. Collaboration between countries and organizations is crucial to preventing the spread of the virus and protecting the health of the global population.\n\nThe Nipah virus is a serious threat to public health, but the development of a vaccine offers hope for the future. The clinical trials that are now beginning are a testament to human determination to overcome health challenges. It is a reminder of the power of scientific research and the possibility of saving lives and protecting communities. As we await the results of these trials, we can hope for a world where the Nipah virus no longer poses a threat to public health.",

Ogden's story is an inspiring tale of hope and the power of the sea that has touched the world and helped her find her lost prosthesis. Ogden, who has lived with an amputation for years, had received a new, custom-made titanium prosthesis designed specifically to help her with swimming and other physical activities. One day last April, while preparing to swim in the North Sea, her prosthesis was suddenly swept away by a strong wave. Ogden was devastated, knowing that replacing the prosthesis would be expensive and time-consuming. She had used the prosthesis for months and had built a strong bond with it. She felt like a part of her had been swept away. Ogden did not give up hope and began a search for her lost prosthesis. She sought help from local divers, beach walkers, and even the coast guard. She also posted messages on social media and in local newspapers, hoping that someone would find her prosthesis. Weeks passed, and there was no trace of her prosthesis. Ogden began to doubt whether she would ever find her prosthesis again. But then, one day in February of this year, she received a phone call from a stranger who said he had found her prosthesis. The man, who was walking on the beach, had accidentally found the prosthesis on the beach, precisely where Ogden had lost it. He had taken the prosthesis home and had searched the internet to see if anyone could help him find the owner. Eventually, he came across Ogden's post on social media and decided to call her. Ogden was overwhelmed with joy and could not believe that her prosthesis had been returned after 10 months. She was so grateful for the help of the stranger and for the power of the sea, which had brought her prosthesis back.

By guaranteeing a stable income, artists can focus on creating their work without having to worry about their livelihood. This initiative could also serve as an example for other countries, which may be inspired to implement similar programs. Another notable news of the week is the progress made in the fight against female genital mutilation (FGM). Through global efforts, significant steps have been taken to eliminate this harmful practice. This is a victory for the rights of women and girls around the world. It is a reminder that through collaboration and determination, even the most entrenched practices can be changed. There are also positive developments in nature. In Norway, polar bears have shown themselves to be resilient to changing conditions. This is a sign of hope for the future of this iconic species, which is often seen as an indicator of the health of the polar region. The resilience of polar bears is a reminder that, while the challenges of climate change are enormous, there are still possibilities for adaptation and survival.

    "title": "Congress defies Trump on tariffs amid ongoing spat with Canada",
    "summary": "In a rare bipartisan show of defiance, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a resolution to block President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canada amid rising tensions between the two countries. The resolution, introduced by Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, would rescind the tariffs Trump imposed on Canada under a national emergency declaration. The vote was 219 to 211, with six Republicans joining Democrats to defy Trump and GOP leadership. One Democrat, Representative Jared Golden of Maine, voted against the resolution.\n\nThe voting action followed a failed attempt by Republican leaders to block the effort through a procedural maneuver, when three GOP lawmakers sided with Democrats to allow debate to move forward. Trump publicly warned Republicans not to cross him and threatened political retaliation against anyone who voted against tariffs. \"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social ahead of the vote.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats who opposed the tariffs cite economic impacts as their primary reason. \"Today's vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person, Donald J. Trump?\" said Meeks, the author of the resolution, ahead of the vote. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat, said in a statement after the vote that \"sycophantic Republicans in the House have tried to block us from acting on behalf of the American people\" and that Trump's tariffs were \"causing prices to skyrocket and creating unnecessary uncertainty for American families.\"\n\nRepublican Don Bacon of Nebraska, who voted against tariffs on Canada alongside the Democrats, said: \"As an old-fashioned Conservative I know tariffs are a tax on American consumers.\" Bacon will be retiring and won't seek reelection in the midterm. The resolution now heads to the Senate. But even if it passes, Trump is expected to veto it, making the effort largely symbolic.\n\nThe congressional rebellion comes as Trump's dispute with Canada intensifies. In January, Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney reached a trade agreement with China, which offered China a quota for EV exports in exchange for certain agricultural tariffs on Canada being dropped. Trump then threatened to block the opening of a new bridge between Michigan and Ontario and demanded some ownership of the bridge that Canada paid for.\n\nAlthough a conversation between Carney and Trump has de-escalated threats on the bridge, it is clear that sentiment toward the U.S. in Canada has soured. According to Statistics Canada, Canadians returning to Canada after traveling in the U.S. took a dive in early 2025 and are down about a quarter from the year before as of November 2025. After Canadian provinces launched a boycott against American alcohol products, U.S. spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025 and fell below $10 million in export value, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.\n\nThe resolution passed by the House is a rare bipartisan challenge to Trump's trade policy and a sign of growing concern within Congress about the economic impact of Trump's tariffs. It is also a sign of growing dissent within the Republican Party over Trump's trade policy. While the resolution is unlikely to lead to the rescission of the tariffs, it is an important statement from Congress that it does not agree with Trump's approach.\n\nThe tensions between the U.S. and Canada have been increasing in recent months, particularly since Trump began his second term. Trump has repeatedly criticized Canada and accused the country of unfair trade practices. He has also threatened further tariffs if Canada does not meet his demands. The tensions have led to a deterioration in relations between the two countries and have affected trade and economic growth.\n\nThe resolution passed by the House is a response to Trump's recent tariffs on Canada. In March, Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports, citing national security reasons. The tariffs have led to an increase in the price of steel and aluminum products in the U.S. and have further strained relations between the two countries. The resolution passed by the House is an attempt to block the tariffs and improve relations between the two countries.\n\nThe resolution is a rare bipartisan challenge to Trump's trade policy and a sign of growing concern within Congress about the economic impact of Trump's tariffs.

    "title": "DeepMind's CEO Works in Two Shifts: 'I Come Alive at 1 a.m.'",
    "summary": "Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently revealed his unique work schedule during an interview at the SXSW London event. Hassabis, a visionary in the world of artificial intelligence, has a peculiar approach to his workday that he has maintained for over a decade. He works in two shifts and sleeps only six hours per night, a routine he has perfected to maximize his creativity and productivity. This approach is not only fascinating but also an example of how top executives manage their time to achieve their goals. Hassabis' day begins with a busy agenda filled with back-to-back meetings, leaving him with almost no time in between. After a day of work, he spends time with his family and has dinner. Then, he starts his second workday at 10 p.m. and works until 4 a.m. During these nighttime hours, he conducts his most creative and research-oriented work. Hassabis explains that he feels most alive at 1 a.m. and develops his best ideas and solutions during these hours. This routine is not only unique but also a testament to his dedication to his work and his ability to manage his time effectively. Hassabis' approach is similar to that of other tech entrepreneurs, such as Elon Musk and Marc Benioff, who have also developed their own unique work schedules to achieve their goals. Musk, for instance, has stated that he functions best with about six hours of sleep, while Benioff averages eight hours of sleep per night. However, Hassabis' routine is unique because he splits his workday into two shifts, allowing him to balance both his professional and personal responsibilities. This approach has enabled him to found and build DeepMind into one of the leading research centers in the field of artificial intelligence. Hassabis' work has contributed to significant breakthroughs in the field, such as the development of tools like Gemini and Nano Banana, and his research on protein structure prediction earned him and his colleague John Jumper the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Hassabis' story is an inspiration to aspiring entrepreneurs and professionals who are looking to carve out their own path to success. His ability to manage his time effectively and his dedication to his work are traits that contribute to his success. While his routine may not be suitable for everyone, it offers a glimpse into the world of a top executive and the strategies he uses to achieve his goals. Hassabis' story is a reminder that success does not solely depend on talent and hard work but also on the ability to manage one's time and energy effectively. His unique work schedule is a testament to his dedication and creativity, and it serves as an example of how one can find their own path to success in the world of artificial intelligence and technology.",

    "title": "Olympic Skier Tess Johnson: Daily Writing is the Key to Her Performance",
    "summary": "Olympic skier Tess Johnson, 25, reveals that a simple daily habit powers her performance — and it doesn't involve the gym. The American mogul skier never travels to competitions without her journal. Johnson journals twice daily — and also carves out time to write before her races. She says journaling gets her in the right headspace and helps her stay present and off her phone. Johnson starts and ends every day with the same ritual that helps her perform under pressure. In an interview with Town & Country Magazine published on Wednesday, the American mogul skier said she always packs her journal when she travels for competitions. 'I do a little bit of journaling in the morning to set my day, set my goals for the day and a little bit of gratitude, but then in the evening I let it all out and it's a little bit like word vomit, but whatever I need to just get out to get a good night of sleep,' Johnson said. Johnson made the US national team at 14 — the youngest athlete to do so at the time — and later became the youngest American freestyle skier to medal at the World Championships. She debuted at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and reached the finals at the 2026 Milan Cortina Games, where she finished 10th. Johnson, whose grandfather was a former Sports Illustrated writer who covered the Olympics, said journaling plays a key role in her mental preparation. She believes she inherited her love of writing from her grandfather and now uses journaling as a practical training tool to track her progress in skiing. 'And also an emotional tool to just work through whatever anxieties are happening because this is a very intense sport and process that we're going through,' Johnson said. 'It's really helpful to get it all out on paper and sift through it just by putting pen to paper. So it does a lot for me. And at the very least, it's just a way to stay present and get off my phone from time to time,' she continued. Johnson added that she occasionally rereads her old journals, including those from the 2018 Olympics. 'It's really cool to see the progress I've made over the years,' she said. Apart from being a part of her daily routine, journaling is also a key part of her pre-race ritual. 'The night before I like to journal, whatever in training that day, any other thoughts that I need to get out. Then the morning of, I'll write down three goals for the day, usually relating to my skiing or a mental performance goal, or just something even maybe not related to skiing, just that I have for the day, and then I'll write down a couple things that I'm grateful for as well,' Johnson said, adding that she does her warm ups after that. Johnson isn't the only elite athlete who has embraced journaling as part of their routine. Michael Phelps told Business Insider in 2023 that he uses writing to reflect and unwind, while WNBA star Caitlin Clark has incorporated journaling into her pregame ritual to clear her head and stay focused. Meanwhile, other Olympians are leaning into surprisingly old-school hobbies in their downtime, including cross-country skier Ben Ogden, who said knitting helps him relax.",

    "summary": "In a world where artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are becoming an increasingly integral part of our daily lives, we see an interesting dynamic emerging between two of the biggest players in this field: ChatGPT and Claude. While ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, decides to introduce ads for non-subscribers, Anthropic, the company behind Claude, chooses a different strategy. They decided to give free users extra features, which is a surprising and positive step in the competition between these two AI giants. This decision by Anthropic is not only a smart move but also a sign of their dedication to their users. By offering extra features without cost, they create a valuable experience for their users, which in turn can lead to greater loyalty and engagement. This is a strategy that may inspire other companies in the sector to also offer more value to their free users. The introduction of ads by ChatGPT is a logical step in their business strategy, as they are looking for ways to generate revenue. However, it is notable that they are taking this step while simultaneously offering their subscriptions. This could lead to a situation where non-subscribers may feel irritated by the ads and consider subscribing to avoid them. On the other hand, by giving Claude extra features to their free users, Anthropic creates a situation where users may be less inclined to subscribe, as they are already satisfied with what they get for free. This can create an interesting dynamic in the market, where users may choose the service that offers the most value, regardless of whether they pay or not. It is also remarkable that these decisions are being made at a time when the competition between AI chatbots is increasing. With new players regularly entering the market, it is essential for existing companies to retain and satisfy their users. By offering extra features, Claude can distinguish itself from the competition and maintain a strong position in the market. This is a strategy that is not only beneficial for the users but also for the company itself, as it can lead to a larger market share and a stronger brand name. Furthermore, it is also a sign of innovation and creativity within the company. By experimenting with different strategies and listening to their users, they can find new ways to create value and distinguish themselves from the competition. This is an approach that other companies in the sector could consider following. It is also interesting to see how these decisions can impact the overall user experience with AI chatbots. While ChatGPT may introduce more ads, Claude can focus on improving the user experience by offering extra features. This could lead to a situation where users may choose Claude for the better experience, even if they have to pay for some features. On the other hand, users who are irritated by ads on ChatGPT may consider subscribing to avoid them. This could lead to a situation where both companies ultimately benefit, as they satisfy their users in different ways. It is also important to emphasize that these decisions are not only impactful on the users but also on the overall development of the AI sector. By experimenting with different strategies and listening to their users, companies can find new ways to create value and further develop the sector. This is an approach that is essential for the growth and innovation of the sector. In conclusion, the decision by Anthropic to offer extra features to free users of Claude is a positive and surprising step in the competition between AI chatbots. It is a sign of their dedication to their users and their willingness to experiment with different strategies to create value. This is an approach that other companies in the sector could consider following, as it can lead to greater user engagement and loyalty. Furthermore, it is also a sign of innovation and creativity within the company, which is essential for the growth and development of the sector. It is exciting to see how this dynamic will develop in the future and what impact it will have on the overall user experience with AI chatbots.",

    "summary": "In the world of archaeology, there are often surprising discoveries that provide insight into the complex societies of the past. Recent research has brought to light that bird droppings, specifically guano, played a crucial role in the rise of one of the most influential pre-Incan societies along the Peruvian coast. This discovery, made by Dr. Jacob Bongers, an archaeologist specializing in Andean cultures, has surprised the scientific community and offers a new perspective on how natural resources have shaped the course of history. \n\nDr. Bongers' research focuses on the coastal region of Peru, where ancient Andean cultures thrived. One of the greatest challenges for these societies was improving soil fertility to practice agriculture. The Peruvian coast is known for its poor, dry soil, which is little suited for intensive agriculture. However, the ancient Andeans found a way to overcome this challenge, and that was by using guano, the droppings of seabirds. \n\nGuano is an extremely nutritious fertilizer, rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and other essential nutrients that stimulate plant growth. The ancient Andeans collected guano from the islands off the coast and used it to fertilize their fields. This resulted in a significant increase in agricultural production, which in turn enabled the growth of complex societies. \n\nDr. Bongers' discovery is based on extensive archaeological research, including the analysis of ancient fields, potsherds, and other artifacts. He has also studied historical sources to gain insight into how the ancient Andeans used guano and how this influenced their societies. His research shows that guano was not only important in agriculture but also in the politics and economy of ancient Andean societies. \n\nOne of the most remarkable findings of Dr. Bongers is that control over guano-rich islands was a source of power and wealth. Societies that had access to these islands could increase their agricultural production and thus support their population. This led to greater political and military power, allowing these societies to expand and dominate other groups. \n\nDr. Bongers' discovery also has implications for our current understanding of sustainability and environmental management. The ancient Andeans had a deep understanding of the natural cycle and knew how to use the resources of their environment responsibly. Their use of guano was not only a means to increase their agricultural production but also a way to manage and preserve the natural resources of their environment. \n\nThis discovery is a reminder that the history of humanity is not only shaped by great events and conflicts but also by the small, often unnoticed details of daily life. The ancient Andeans found a way to use the droppings of seabirds to strengthen and grow their societies. Their story is an inspiration to us all, to learn from the past and find applications for our current challenges. \n\nDr. Bongers' research is an important contribution to our understanding of ancient Andean cultures and their influence on world history. It is a reminder that the natural resources of our environment can be a powerful source of power and wealth, and that we learn from the past to build a more sustainable future.",

    "summary": "In an era where the world grapples with the consequences of climate change, Australian researchers bring a groundbreaking solution to the forefront. A team of innovative scientists has developed a dual-purpose paint that not only lowers temperature but also contributes to solving water scarcity. This is a breakthrough that can offer a hopeful future, especially for drought-stricken regions. \n\nThe paint, recently developed by a team from the University of Melbourne, combines the properties of cool paint and a water-absorbing coating. Cool paint is already known for its ability to cool surfaces by reflecting infrared radiation, significantly lowering the temperature of buildings and streets. But this new paint goes a step further by also absorbing and storing water from the air, making it available for plants and other uses. \n\nThe impact of this paint is enormous. In areas where water is scarce and temperatures soar, this paint can be a lifeline. By lowering the temperature, it reduces the need for air conditioning, which in turn decreases energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the water storage function provides a valuable source of water for irrigation and other purposes. \n\nThe paint is made from eco-friendly materials and is designed to be durable and cost-effective. This makes it a feasible solution for both developed and developing countries. The researchers have already seen positive results in pilot projects in drought-stricken areas in Australia, where the paint has contributed to a significant temperature drop and improved water availability. \n\nThe future of this paint is promising. The researchers are now working on optimizing the formula and expanding the applications. They hope that this paint can be deployed on a large scale to mitigate the impact of drought and heat, contributing to a more sustainable future. \n\nThis innovation is an example of how science and technology can work together to tackle the biggest challenges of our time. It is a step forward in the fight against climate change and an inspiration for other researchers and inventors around the world. With this paint, we can not only improve the quality of life but also contribute to a healthier and more sustainable environment. \n\nIn a world increasingly confronted with the consequences of drought and heat, this paint offers a hopeful solution. It is an innovation with the potential to save lives, protect ecosystems, and build a more sustainable future. The future of this paint is bright, and its impact on the world can be enormous. It is a step forward in the right direction and an inspiration for everyone working on solutions to the challenges of our time.",

    "title": "A US Army general says new command tech lets him ditch the 'hourlong staff meeting' - NGC2 has been developed through an iterative process involving soldiers, leadership, and command.",
    "summary": "The US Army's new command and control system is giving commanders more access and information for decision-making. The platform is being iteratively developed between the Army and industry through a series of tests. The Army has prioritized breaking down communication walls while developing NGC2.\n\nNew US Army warfighting software is speeding up and simplifying the command job, a commander said recently, sharing that it lets him scrap the 'hourlong staff meetings' to make decisions. The Army, like other services, believes that future wars will be determined by the speed of decision-making. That's where the new Next Generation Command and Control, or NGC2, program is expected to make a substantial impact and modernize how the service fights.\n\nAt Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army's 4th Infantry Division has been testing NGC2 in a series of exercises. The most recent one, Ivy Sting 4, added more components to the system, with different types of sensors and weapons on the battlefield feeding into one system that everyone can access.\n\n\"So it's all in one place, and it's there very, very quickly, so that the staff can see it across their functional systems,\" said Maj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, commander of the 4th ID, at a recent media roundtable, explaining that \"the fires person can see what the logistician sees, can see what the intel person sees.\" \n\n\"I don't have to have the hourlong staff meeting anymore,\" the general said.\n\nThe Army's new NGC2 system is predicting supply needs and simulating enemy actions.\n\n\"If we're actually using the technology as the tool that we're prepping on and that we're also fighting on,\" he said, \"I could sit there, I can look at it, I can make decisions, I can say, 'Hey, here are my priorities for this or that.' We all agree on it, we click save, and that's done.\"\n\nThe Army has facilitated the development of NGC2 with both the 4th ID and 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii and industry teams, including Anduril and Lockheed Martin, pursuing a Silicon Valley-style approach aimed at moving faster and rapidly integrating soldier feedback, delivering fixes immediately rather than months or years later.\n\nOn the heels of Ivy Sting 4, more than two weeks of field testing that involved live-fire exercises and an electronic warfare jamming scenario, Ellis and others said that NGC2 was making planning and executing battlefield missions more effective.\n\n\"We are no longer fighting with the network; we are now fighting using the network,\" Ellis said.\n\nDuring the Ivy Sting 4 testing event, 20 different types of sensors, such as drones, electronic warfare systems, artillery, and Stryker vehicles, were linked together.\n\nThe latest live-fire exercise included a variety of systems, weapons, drones, and capabilities.\n\nData and artificial intelligence capabilities provide real-time information on the sensors. Soldiers can see how much ammunition they've got left or whether a Stryker will need maintenance or fuel soon. Simulations can predict what resources will be needed for certain tactics or actions, including different ways an enemy might attack.\n\nAs different platforms are brought onto NGC2, broadening what the platform can do, Army command and soldiers can see and communicate using the same data. The system is breaking down the silos that have previously hindered information flow.\n\n\"I'm feeling empowered as a commander to make more, better, and faster decisions because I've got access to all that data,\" Ellis explained.\n\nMany NGC2 components are being built with off-the-shelf technology and standard commercial software practices, and the vendor teams involved are working on the ground with soldiers. The closer working relationship means soldier feedback is being incorporated more quickly.\n\n\"We work through these obstacles, and we learn how to do something, and once we run into a roadblock, we figure out a way to solve that problem, and then that problem is now solved for the Army,\" he said. \"We're not relearning these lessons over and over again.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider.",

    "title": "AI in the workplace is expanding responsibilities and intensifying work - Research by the Haas School of Business found that AI expands responsibilities in the workplace.",
    "summary": "Research by the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business found that AI expanded responsibilities in the workplace. The study on a company with 200 employees found that workers multitasked more and worked longer. Sam Altman had previously addressed how AI accelerates the work cycle in an interview.\n\nIf you think using AI means doing less at work, think again. In a new eight-month study of how generative AI changed work habits at a US-based tech company with about 200 employees, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business found that employees' work intensified in three main ways. Employees multitasked more, took on a broader range of responsibilities, and worked longer hours, often without being asked to do so.\n\nAruna Ranganathan, a professor in management at UC Berkeley, and Xingqi Maggie Ye, a Ph.D. student at the Haas School of Business, detailed their research in a Harvard Business Review story, writing that once AI tools became available, workers began to usurp each other's roles, feed information to AI during meetings, and correct each other's vibe coding projects. 'Workers described this as 'just trying things' with the AI, but these experiments accumulated into a meaningful widening of job scope,' wrote Ranganathan and Ye. 'In fact, workers increasingly absorbed work that might previously have justified additional help or head count.'\n\nThe researchers wrote that many workers also send prompts to AI before leaving their desk for a meeting or for lunch break, so AI could continue to work without supervision. 'These actions rarely felt like doing more work, yet over time they produced a workday with fewer natural pauses and a more continuous involvement with work,' Ranganathan and Ye added.\n\nIn an October 2025 interview with Rowan Cheung, who hosts the Rowan's Notes interview series, Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, also shared ways in which AI may have made his work more intense. 'It's almost like, I don't think I can come up with ideas fast enough anymore,' Altman told Cheung. 'I really do have a hard time trying to reason through exactly what this is going to mean. I think it will mean that stuff just happens faster and that you can try a lot more stuff and figure out the better ideas quickly.'",

    "title": "Failing fast is a lot harder than it sounds - Some companies are adopting a fail-fast mentality",
    "summary": "Irish playwright Samuel Beckett's famous quote, 'Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.', has become Corporate America's new mantra. From Okta to Salesforce to Blackstone, executives told BI's Sarah E. Needleman and Ana Altchek that getting it wrong is ok. Just do it quickly and learn from it. The tech industry has always been a big proponent of failing fast, but Corporate America is now catching on thanks to AI. The technology allows companies to quickly launch new tools to a wide group. And, perhaps more importantly, it's a way for executives to prove the big money they are spending on AI isn't going to waste. (Hence why they want you to fail fast.) It's not just for launching products either. Even the ideation phase can be quickly sped up with chatbots that can talk through ideas. What previously might have taken executives (or, more likely, their underlings) hours of research can get figured out a lot faster. There are still some hurdles with the fail-fast approach. What does failing even look like? There isn't a big, red alarm that goes off every time an AI project fails. (Although that sure would be fun.) Executives will say they set clear guidelines for a prototype beforehand, but a tool's benefits can be nuanced. And maybe you just need a little bit more time to really make it sing. All that makes it a lot harder to decide when to pull the plug. The rush to get things out can lead to the belief you'll just fix things on the fly. But that's a dangerous precedent. Just ask the video game industry. When games came in physical copies you had to blow on to get working, companies made sure their product was bulletproof. Nowadays, they can digitally ship a game knowing an update for a glitch won't be far behind. It's a dangerous game that can cause major headaches. A formalized product launch slows things down, but it also makes sure everyone is on the same page. A massive greenlight risks a lack of standardization. That might not seem like a big deal for a prototype. It becomes a bigger problem down the road if the product needs to be reconfigured to fit into the company's wider tech stack.",

    "title": "Forget WhatsApp: this free retro-alternative offers off-grid option",
    "summary": "In a world where we are increasingly dependent on the internet and mobile connections, it is refreshing to discover an alternative that allows us to stay in touch without these technologies. Meshtastic is such an innovative and free alternative that uses a peer-to-peer mesh network to enable communication without the internet or mobile data. This article delves deeper into what Meshtastic is, how it works, and why it can be a valuable addition to our communication capabilities.\n\nMeshtastic is an open-source project designed to create a decentralized network where users can communicate directly with each other without relying on central servers or internet providers. Instead, Meshtastic uses a mesh network, where each device (or 'node') acts as a router. When a message is sent, it is passed from node to node until it reaches the intended recipient. This means you can still communicate even in areas with poor or no mobile coverage, as long as there are a number of nodes nearby.\n\nTo use Meshtastic, you need a special device, such as the Meshtastic prototype or other compatible hardware. These devices are equipped with a microcontroller and a radio frequency module that enables short-range communication. Although this means you need to purchase an additional device, Meshtastic offers a unique and reliable way to stay in touch, especially in situations where traditional communication methods are not available.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of Meshtastic is the ability to communicate off-grid. This is particularly useful in emergency situations, while camping, or in areas with limited infrastructure. Because the network is decentralized, it is also much harder to censor or hack, making it a safe option for users who value their privacy. Additionally, Meshtastic is completely free and open-source, meaning anyone can contribute to the development and improvement of the project.\n\nWhile Meshtastic is still in development and may not offer all the features you are used to from apps like WhatsApp, it provides a unique and valuable way to stay in touch without relying on the internet or mobile data. It is an inspiring example of how technology can be used to connect us, even in the most challenging circumstances. Whether you are looking for a reliable way to stay in touch during an emergency, or are simply interested in exploring new communication options, Meshtastic is definitely worth a try.",

But in China, they are focusing on so-called quadrupeds: robot dogs that sometimes run faster than Usain Bolt.",
    "summary": "In the world of technology and innovation, humanoid robots are currently a hot topic. Many tech companies worldwide are working on the development of robots that resemble humans and take over tasks that we ourselves have little interest in. Think of cleaning houses, performing dangerous tasks, or assisting with medical procedures. These robots are designed to make our lives easier and safer. But while the rest of the world is focusing on humanoid robots, China is taking a different approach: quadrupeds, or robot dogs.\n\nQuadrupeds are robots that walk on four legs, similar to dogs. They are designed to move quickly and efficiently, even on uneven terrain. Some of these robot dogs can even run faster than the fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt. This is an impressive feat and shows how far technology has advanced.\n\nThe advantages of quadrupeds are numerous. They are versatile and can be used in a wide range of applications. Think of their use in agriculture, where they can help with crop care or data collection. They can also be deployed in industry, where they can perform dangerous tasks that would otherwise have to be done by humans. Additionally, they can be used in the healthcare sector, where they can assist in patient care or perform medical procedures.\n\nAnother advantage of quadrupeds is that they are much more stable than humanoid robots. They have a lower center of gravity and can better adapt to uneven terrain. This makes them ideal for use in environments where humanoid robots may not be able to function.\n\nMoreover, quadrupeds are also much cheaper than humanoid robots. This makes them more accessible to a wider audience and allows for their implementation on a larger scale. This is especially important in countries like China, where the demand for technology and innovation is enormous.\n\nThe technology behind quadrupeds is also much simpler than that of humanoid robots. This means they require less maintenance and break down less often. This is a big advantage, especially in environments where maintenance and repairs are difficult.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest advantage of quadrupeds is that they are much less intimidating than humanoid robots. They resemble animals more than humans, making them less intimidating for people who might be afraid of robots that resemble humans. This is especially important in environments where people might be afraid of technology or might not trust technology.\n\nIn short, while the rest of the world is focusing on humanoid robots, China is taking a different approach: quadrupeds. These robots are versatile, stable, affordable, and easy to maintain. They can be deployed in a wide range of applications and are less intimidating than humanoid robots. It is a smart choice for China to invest in this technology, and it is a choice that may well determine the future of robotics.",

    "title": "How to Have the Perfect Week",
    "summary": "It's easy to fall into the trap of only striving for the spectacular highlights of life. We are often inspired by the big moments, such as weddings, travels, or other special events. But what if we focus on the 'ordinary' weeks, which can be just as fulfilling? Let's take a look at how we can create a perfect week, filled with small joys and meaningful moments.\n\nA perfect week starts with setting realistic expectations. It's not about creating a week full of spectacular events, but about finding joy in the daily routine. Start each day with a moment of stillness, whether it's a cup of coffee while watching the sunrise, or a short meditation. This helps you to start the day with a calm and focused mind.\n\nNext, it's important to take time for the things that you truly value. Whether it's a hobby, spending time with family or friends, or just a moment for yourself. Consciously schedule these activities in your agenda, just like you would schedule an appointment. This ensures that you make time for the things that make you happy.\n\nA perfect week also includes time for self-care. This can range from a long walk in nature, a relaxing bath, or simply an extra night's sleep. Self-care is not selfish; it's necessary to relax and recharge. It's also important to learn to say no to other commitments when you know you need time for yourself.\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to find a balance between work and private life. Try to set clear boundaries between your work and your personal life. This might mean not taking your work home, or consciously making time to relax and enjoy your free time. A perfect week is a week where you don't overwork yourself and you have time to enjoy the things you like.\n\nFinally, a perfect week is a week where you can cultivate gratitude. Take the time to think about the things you are grateful for, whether it's your health, your family, or just the small joys of life. This can help to shift your focus from what you lack to what you have, and can lead to a greater sense of contentment and happiness.\n\nA perfect week is not necessarily a week full of spectacular events. It's about finding joy in the daily routine, making time for the things you value, and cultivating gratitude. By following these simple steps, you can create a perfect week, filled with small joys and meaningful moments.",
